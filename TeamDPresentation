*“Thus spoke Zeus, and released storm-footed Iris to bear his message.
And in between Samos and also rugged Imbros,
Iris penetrated the inky sea, where its stagnant water roared around her.
She darted into the depths of the ocean, much like a block of lead,
Which is attached upon a field-dwelling ox horn,
Is set out, bearing death unto the flesh-eating fishes”*

#Our Translation

ἥ τε κατ αγραύλοιο βοὸς κέρας:

**ὅτι οὐ λεγεί βοὸς κέρας βοὸς τρίχα δια τὸ τριχίνην εῖναι τὴν
ὁρμίαν** [The sign is there] because he does not mean
"βοὸς κέρας" as "βοὸς τρίχα" on account of the fishing line being made a hair

**λίναις γὰρ ἐχρῶντο ἐκ πόντοιο θύραζε λίνῳ. ένι ήνοπι χαλκῷ**
For they used linen ones
“Out of the sea, he surfaced the linen attached to the gleaming copper (Iliad, 16.408)"


**οἱ δὲ νῦν οὐδε βοείαις χρῶνται ἀλλ' ἱππείαις.** Nowadays, people use
horse's hair instead of bull's hair.

**λέγοι ἂν οὖν βοὸς κέρας κυρίως** Therefore, you could say
"βοὸς κέρας" properly

**κατεσκεύαζον γὰρ σύριγγα· ἐκ κέρατος βοειοῦ, ἣν παρετίθεσαν τῇ ορμίᾳ ὑπερ
τὸ ἄγκιστρον ὅπως μὴ οἱ ϊχθῦς ἀποτρώγωσιτὸν λίνον ⁑** For the used to make a
conduit out of bull's horn, which they attached to the line above the hook
so that fish could not chew on the line.

#Σύριγξ

From Suda On Line:

The part of the axle inserted into the nave of the wheel.

**A syrinx [is] also [sc. any] longish conduit.**

Also σύριγγος, [meaning] a [sc. musical] pipe, or a spear-case.

##W. Houghton's "Ancient Greek and Roman Filed Sports:  I. Ancient Greek and Roman Fishermen" in *Nature and Art*

12.251-254 of Odyssey

ὡς δ᾽ ὅτ᾽ ἐπὶ προβόλῳ ἁλιεὺς περιμήκεϊ ῥάβδῳ
ἰχθύσι τοῖς ὀλίγοισι δόλον κατὰ εἴδατα βάλλων
ἐς πόντον προΐησι βοὸς κέρας ἀγραύλοιο,
ἀσπαίροντα δ᾽ ἔπειτα λαβὼν ἔρριψε θύραζε

“So as one who fares the sea with a towering, projecting rod,
Casting down food as bait for the miniscule fishes,
Sending into the sea the field-dwelling ox horn
Thereafter, fish writhing, he catches it and flings it to the surface”

---

##Plutarch's "Whether Land or Sea Animals are Cleverer" in *Moralia*

“Some misunderstand this and imagine that the ancients used ox-hair for their lines, alleging that keras means "hair" and for this reason keirasthai means "to have one's hair cut" and koura is a "haircut" and the keroplastes in Archilochus is one who is fond of trimming and beautifying the hair. But this is not so: they use horse-hair which they take from males, for mares by wetting the hair with their urine make it weak. Aristarchus declares that there is nothing erudite or subtle in these lines; the fact is that a small piece of horn was attached to the line in front of the hook, since the fish, when they are confronted by anything else, chew the line in two.”
